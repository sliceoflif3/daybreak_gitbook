# my learning path

First, I will spend times re-learn every important data structures, algorithms and concepts. I learned about these in my first year at Uni but forgot everything. I think I can re-learn everything in about a month. Next, I will practice using Leetcode 75 and Neetcode 150. In the meantime, maybe I will also try doing the Odin project so that I can have a side project to put on my CV.&#x20;
